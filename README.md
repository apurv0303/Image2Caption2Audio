# Image2Caption2Audio
**What it does**:It converts given image with its most probable Caption and then converts it in audio mp3 format.

**Real World Application**:It can be useful for visually impaired people to get insights about what is in front of them. It can also be implemented on security cameras to alarm for any suspicious activities.

**Tools and algorithms used**:LSTM,Trasnfer Learning(Pre-trained VGG-16 weights),NLP,Pandas,Numpy,gTTS,Matplotlib
